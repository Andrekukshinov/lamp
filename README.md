# lamp
  To run the project, installing backend dependensies is required (even though target folder already exists), so as to do that you need to have maven and run "mvn clean install" 
commands in "lamp" folder. The next step is running backend. First of all you should change current directory to Disk:/"path to project"/lamp/target 
and execute lamp-1.0-snapshot.jar . Backend is ready. 
  To reprsent UI angular8 was used. To provide frontend with all necessary dependensies node.js is required. In the folder frontend you should run "npm install" to settle 
all dependensies. When it's ready you can fire up the last part of the app with "ng start" instead of "ng serve" as there's a config file that defines backend server.
